"ATTN: BENEFICIARY,

I am contacting you with great confidence and trust regarding a Abandoned sum of $18,500,000.00 USD (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) currently sitting in the Suspense Account of our Overseas Bank. This fund belonged to a deceased client who shares your same Last Name and unfortunately died in a tragic plane crash with no Legal heir. The Board of Directors has mandated me to locate the Next of Kin or the funds will be reverted to the Government Treasury. I have decided to contact you to stand as the Next of Kin so we can split the transfer 50/50. This transaction is 100% risk free and legal. Kindly get back to me immediately with your Full Name, Direct Phone Number, and Bank Details to proceed. Please keep this STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL for security reasons.

Waiting for your urgent response, Dr. George Barrister",1
