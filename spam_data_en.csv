Just following up on the invoice below.

Important Update: Our bank is currently undergoing a semi-annual audit, so our regular USD account is frozen for 48 hours.

Please send this specific payment to our subsidiary account instead to avoid shipment delays. I have attached the new wiring instructions.

Thanks, Steve

steve.miller@vendor-supplies.com,"Body: Hi Alex,

Our accounting team noticed you underpaid the last invoice by $0.50 due to a currency conversion error.

Don't worry about wiring it separately. We will just add it to the January invoice as a line item. Just wanted to give you a heads up so your records match ours.

Best, Steve",0
